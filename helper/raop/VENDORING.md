# Vendored OwnTone sources

`vendor/` is copied from [owntone-server](https://github.com/owntone/owntone-server)
at commit `a038de21065bbbfec721c9c974e3bbd30b22fd59` (2026-09-16):

- `outputs/raop.c`, `outputs/rtp_common.{c,h}` — the AirPlay 1 (RAOP)
  sender: RTSP handshake, encrypted-RTP/ALAC packetization, timing/sync
- `evrtsp/` — RTSP client over libevent (forked from evrtsp; `log.h` is
  BSD-licensed by Niels Provos)
- `pair_ap/` — AirPlay device verification / PIN pairing (fruit + HomeKit)
- `transcode.{c,h}` — PCM → ALAC encode via FFmpeg libraries
- `misc.{c,h}`, `outputs.h`, `db.h` — shared OwnTone infrastructure

OwnTone is GPL-2.0-or-later; the vendored files keep their copyright and
license headers. The Melofon server is AGPL-3.0-or-later and talks to this
helper over its stdin protocol — two programs, no library mixing.

Not vendored (stubbed in `stub/` instead, because the helper has none of
them): the config file, syslog logger, database, player, artwork cache, DMAP
metadata, mDNS discovery, HTTP icy metadata. `stub/config.h` is the
hand-written autoconf `config.h` stand-in for Linux.

Do not "sync" these files wholesale from upstream without re-running
`make test`; the helper relies on exact struct layouts (`struct raop_extra`
is mirrored in `main.c`).
